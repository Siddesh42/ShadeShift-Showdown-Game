# ShadeShift-Showdown-Game
I have developed a simple game project that involves shifting the color of a rectangle. When the mouse moves over the left side, the rectangle transitions from a light red shade to a dark red shade, while on the opposite side, the color shifts from a light blue hue to a deep blue hue.
